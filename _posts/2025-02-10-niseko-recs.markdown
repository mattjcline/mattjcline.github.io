## Ripping

- Grand Hirafu: Village at the base of Niseko resort. Essentially the Vail of Japan. There are a lot of ex-pats from Hong Kong and a ton of Australians in Hirafu. It's less traditional Japan. Regardless, it is so epic and huge. So much snow. You could easily spend 4-5 days there, but it is worth exploring even beyond. Get the entire mountain pass. It's really 4 resorts smashed together on the side of a volcano, and you can get individual resort passes, but you want the freedom to go everywhere. And you should explore. Almost everything you see is doable or hikeable. Don't be afraid of avy gates either. Japan is relatively flat, and the danger of avalanche is pretty low. Enjoy your time with Jagata-kun or “fat little potato boy” the beloved mascot of Niseko.
- Gear Rental
  - You can rent top-of-the-line gear in Niseko if you don't want to lug your stuff. We rented from [Rhythm Japan](https://www.rhythmjapan.com/), pre-book recommended.
- On Mountain at Niseko: (once you're there, this will make more sense)
  - We spent most of our time in the Hirafu and Hanazono area.
  - With good weather and conditions, we would go to the top and ride all the way down. Typically starting on the top of Ace pair lift #3, then going down skiers’ right of King Hooded Quad #3 through the trees, then down under the gondola and through a gate past Boyo-so, staying in the trees.
  - There are some fun trees with a good grade off Hanazono Hooded Quad Lift #3 as well. This area is pretty sick.
  - It can get super socked in and windy, but there is somewhere on the mountain that will be good, so don't get discouraged!
  - Side Country:
    - Off Ace Pair #4, we had fun getting into side country through Gate 3 and 4.
    - Out of Gate 4, you can ride down to Hanazono Hooded Quad Lift #3. As a boarder, be careful not to go too far left, or you’ll lose the grade to get you there and have to hike.
    - If you hike up from Gate 3, you can actually ride around the back of the mountain and into the Annupuri area, which is fun. Bring avalanche gear (you can rent it if you want in town in about 5 minutes - it's a transceiver, shovel, and probe in a backpack).
    - There is a ravine between the Hirafu Gondola and Hanazono Quad Lift #2 that you can drop in anywhere and get to a cat track that connects to the Hirafu gondola base. Part of the cat track is slightly uphill. If you get stuck, you can drop off it skiers left, and there is enough grade there to ride back to base. Don’t go too low as there is a creek below, but there are a lot of quality spots here where a lot of ski/snowboard movies are filmed.
    - We accessed the ravine by hiking up skiers left from the quad, going through Gate 9, and dropping in from the top of Swinging Monkey chair. We found some fun smaller cliffs off that face.
    - On Mountain Lunch:
      - Ate at almost Boyo-so every day. It was great.
- Backcountry
  - We booked a day-long tour through [Niseko Photography & Guiding](https://www.nisekophotography.com/resort-ski-snowboard-tours-3/). It was absolutely incredible. A guide will show you around Niseko, assess your skill in-resort, you’ll do a ~1 hour hike out of the resort up one of the peaks of Niseko and then down a seemingly endless backcountry run of waist deep snow.
  - The guide provided avy gear and drove us home after the backcountry run.
- Rusutsu
  - So sick and more traditional Japanese.
  - There’s a ~30min shuttle from Hirafu base where you can buy tickets a day or so in advance.
  - WILD experience. Roller coasters everywhere, crazy shopping mall you walk into to buy your tickets, it's a trip. The real resort is on the opposite side from the roller coaster though, so don't get distracted. The resort itself is a playground. Great on powder days.
- Other notes from another buddy
  - Unless you're night skiing at Niseko just get the 8hr day pass. Night skiing is sick though there, and you can get a separate pass for that if you decide.
  - The mountain is not very steep which can be a problem with a lot of powder. The ski map is deceiving, after the first day we spent some time with Google Maps looking at where the lifts are and the topography to better understand the resort. The piste gets skied off pretty quickly but powder tends to stick around in the trees so that's where we spent most of our time.

## In town

- I’ve only ever stayed at Niseko Park Hotel. It has a great onsen, delicious breakfast buffet, and is mostly occupied by Japanese.
- Bars
  - Bar Gyu+ (The Fridge door)
  - Toshiro’s Bar
  - Buddha Bar
  - Wild Bill's
  - Bigfoot Lodge
  - Baddies - a true snowboard bar, it's super fun. Sounds silly, but every pro snowboarder that cruises through Niseko stops in here. They also have a tattoo parlor in the bar... careful.
  - The Bunker
  - The Edge
  - Niseko Taproom
- Restaurants
  - There is a building called Odin Place right in the center of Hirafu. There are 4 or 5 restaurants in here, and we ate at every single one.
  - Green Farm Cafe - good breakfast sandwiches
  - Niseko Ramen Kazahana
- Other
  - The streets are RIDICULOUSLY slippery. Fair warning. Just be careful when you're walking outside day or night. Everyone slips at some point.
  - Onsen
    - Get to an onsen. Traditional Japanese bathing experience. It can feel uncomfortable, but once you accept it, your muscles will thank you and you’ll shred better. Search YouTube for “onsen etiquette” for the protocol.
    - We went to Onsen Yukoro, they're all over town though.
