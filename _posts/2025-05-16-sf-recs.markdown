# SF Recommendations

## Cocktails

*   [Pacific Cocktail Haven](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FtAmisJWHprUB6E86) - As of 2025 this was #16 on the Top 50 Bars in North America. They’re pros. Drinks ~$20 each. 
*   [ABV](https://maps.app.goo.gl/btXHLy4cBUh21eSRA) - #39 on that same list. Very fun, great food. 
*   [Trick Dog](https://maps.app.goo.gl/w37hbFM2cgyMLp3E9) - Rotating menu, almost always on-point. Can get crowded so either arrive early or be ready to stand.
*   [True Laurel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XgWKoyRizVhVPWLL8) - Great brunch, great architecture, creative drinks. 
*   [Wildhawk](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3UVT3UyBq9ZWZ6zC7) - Great lil bar in the Mission. Ask for the cocopuff negroni, it’s off menu but they usually have it available. 
*   [Louie’s Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9dAY7njnQdy9M5tb8) - I work here but honestly it’s very fun and the food rocks. More shot-and-beer than cocktail bar but it’s very fun!
*   [Comstock Saloon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2jCXyjWDupVZ9zxH8) - A new North Beach classic. Every bartender has ran a program at another bar. They all have encyclopedic knowledge of spirits and cocktails. Great food too.

## Casual Restaurants

*   [Yamo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iKjYSFWS95joogW96) - Cheap and delicious. One of the few places in SF you can score a <$10 lunch. 
*   [Good Mong Kok](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HgkpH4JezCKqX9pX8) - Some of the best bang-for-buck dim sum in the city. To-go only so walk over to Washington Square Park and enjoy some people watching with your BBQ buns and Har Gao. 
*   [Tartine Manufactory](https://maps.app.goo.gl/p9QuBftVP9zPbvQd8) - Big ole industrial building full of good food. Lil pricey but you don’t always need a reservation. 
*   [Sotto Mare](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QhSekXUjznRiTK9u8) - Family-owned Italian standby in North Beach. Walk-ins only. Have a drink at Columbus Cafe once you put your name down. 
*   [Chuck’s Takeaway](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uNniUbfD52pGofvBA) - Great sandwiches in the Mission. The go-to is a Mission Burrito in Dolores park but this is also a great choice for a park lunch. 

## Restaurants to Book Ahead of Time

*   [Zuni Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mah1uajDYJdsEok19) - brunch, lunch, and dinner all rock here. They’re famous for their roasted chicken with bread salad. Enough for several people and delish. 
*   [Rintaro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3wedw4XRsQoYUCZJ8) - Japanese izakaya food done up and with a Californian influence. Still legit Japanese. Great architecture, great poultry and produce sourcing. 
*   [San Ho Won](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Hujjfpo4oF98r1Ax7) - 1 Michelin star Korean BBQ. It’s a lot of meat but service is tight and the food is delicious. All their banchan is incredible. 
*   [Rich Table](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2EFGSZUvX2ck6Tcn8) - 1 Michelin star Californian food. Great bar program. I’ve done like 5 birthdays here hahah. 
*   [State Bird Provisions](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8bdKjQ9fTPuuAqzW7) -or- [The Progress](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RzUPHRzmmSSFCPM69) - They’re next door to each other and have the same owners. State Bird is small plates that come around on carts and Progress is larger-format. Great food, great wine. The black butter manhattan at Progress is one of my all-time favorite drinks.
